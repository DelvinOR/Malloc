Workload E: malloc() entire memory capacity and free() immediately for a total 150 times. It would be interesting to test this workload against workload A.

Workload F: malloc() 1 byte until we run out of storage space or malloc return null. Immeadiately call free() after successfully malloc()ing. We should have
            all available space back after so then we malloc() max storage space and then free() immediately for a total of 150 times. This is kind of a 
            modification to workload E but in here we are checkiing to see if free() successfully restored our memory.
