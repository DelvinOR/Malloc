Workload E: malloc() entire memory capacity and free() immediately for a total 150 times. We chose this workload to see how our malloc function handles recieving it's max size and freeing max sized blocks. It would be interesting to test this workload against workload A.

Workload F: malloc() 1 byte at a time until we run out of storage space by malloc returning null. Then write to each malloc'd space 1 char. Iterate through all malloc'd data to ensure no corruption. Read from 0-lastmalloc and lastmalloc-0. This workload is great for checking we do not accidentally misalign our returned or recieved pointers thus causing potential clobbering/overwrite.
