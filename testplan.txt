Workload E: malloc() entire memory capacity and free() immediately for a total 150 times. It would be interesting to test this workload against workload A.

Workload F: malloc() 1 byte until you reach the entire memory capacity. Free() all pointers one by one do this 50 times. Given we are malloc() ing until 
            the memory capacity is full, this workload should take the longest. It would be interesting to just how long it would take.
